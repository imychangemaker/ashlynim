One of my new year resolutions in 2023 is to write about my experiences and share with the community. I believe that by sharing and listening to each other, we can empower others to pursue their own career pathway. Turning 25 this year, I feel I have at least some thoughts that I could tell the future generations who are preparing their way to the society, and this is the right time to open my website.

In the upcoming year, I will publish articles in a variety of topics, starting off with the transition from business to tech, challenges, grad school selection, academic studies and so on. I am also planning to discuss some of my experiences in data science and software engineering, for example, how to prepare for the interviews, tips for coding interview etc.

Of course, I'm still new to the industry. Compared to the career coaches on LinkedIn, the articles are documentation to my personal experiences, and hopefully at best some insights for you. Let's stay connected despite the economic downturn.
